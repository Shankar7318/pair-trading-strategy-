#### Pairs Trading using Machine Learning

Pairs trading is a popular market-neutral trading strategy where two assets are identified that move together in the market.
When their prices diverge, one can go long on the underperforming asset and short on the overperforming one, betting that they will revert to their historical relationship (mean reversion). 
### coin integration analysis
Perform cointegration tests to identify pairs of assets that have a long-term equilibrium relationship. Cointegration means that despite short-term deviations, the assets tend to move together in the long run.
### This pairs trading strategy involves:

Cointegration analysis to identify asset pairs.
Machine learning to predict whether the spread will revert or diverge.
Backtesting to evaluate the performance of the trading strategy.
